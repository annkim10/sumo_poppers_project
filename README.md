# Sumo Poppers

## Background ##
Sumo Poppers is a spin on the classic bubble popping games but instead of bubbles...pop sumo wrestlers! Sumo wrestlers will appear randomly on the screen waiting to be popped. Users can move the mouse to pop the sumo before they float away. 


## Functionality & MVPs ##
With Sumo Poppers, users will be able to:
* Move the mouse to direct the pin to pop the sumo
* Reset the game
* Track their score of the number of sumo wrestlers popped

In addition, this project will include:
* A production README
* An About section with instructions on how to play


## Wireframes ##
* Score Tracker
* Game board with mouse movement controls 
* About section with project's Github repo and myLinkedIn link


## Technologies, Libraries, APIs ##
This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

* The Canvas API to render the game board
* Webpack and Babel to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
* npm to manage project dependencies


## Implementation Timeline ##
* _Friday Afternoon & Weekend:_ Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the Canvas API. Design art elements.

* _Monday:__ Dedicate this day toward implementing the underlying logic and building out the classes

* _Tuesday:_ If I didn't get to it already, get the sumos correctly rendered to the canvas. 

* _Wednesday:_ Finish implementing user controls, and focus on styling, as well as implementing the different color schemes and nav links. If time, start on bonuses.

* _Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

## Bonus Features ##
* Add levels that increase speed
* Add sound
